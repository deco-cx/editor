# deco editor

An edge-native & composable digital experience editor.

Use deno, TypeScript, Preact and Tailwind to build any digital experience you can imagine composing data from any API you need, with a beautiful and intuitive visual editor that's **powered by AI**.

Use [deco.cx](https://deco.cx) to **host your own Branded deco platform**. Build your unique feature set and enable your customers to build differentiated digital experiences. Stop reselling other platforms — it's time to **become your own platform.** With deco, you can do just that.

## Features

- **Edge-native** - technology built from the ground up to run on the edge, delivering ultra-low latency rendering for end-users and a great developer experience.
- **Composable** - choose from high-quality building blocks that range from UI components to fully-typed API integrations to quickly build out features, not boilerplate. 
- **Extensible** — Code your own blocks and solve any problem you have, from simple UI components to complex integration workflows. 
- **Bring your own AI** - use any AI service you want to power your editing experience.
- **Managed or self-hosted** - deco is 100% open-source, so you own your content _and_ your code. We offer a managed platform with a global infrastructure at deco.cx. You can also self-host deco on your own infrastructure, or even run it locally.
